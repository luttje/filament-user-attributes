Let your users specify custom attributes for models in Filament. This package uses a polymorphic relationship to store the attributes in a JSON column.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.x or higher
- Filament 3.x or higher
- A database that supports JSON columns, e.g:
    - MySQL 5.7.8 or higher
    - PostgreSQL 9.2 or higher
    - SQLite 3.38 or higher

## Getting started

1. Install the package via composer:

    ```bash
    composer require luttje/filament-user-attributes
    ```

    > **Note** 
    > This package is not yet available on Packagist. You can install it by adding the repository to your `composer.json` file.

2. Add the `HasUserAttributes` trait to the model you want to have custom user attributes on.

    ```php
    use Luttje\FilamentUserAttributes\Traits\HasUserAttributes;

    class Product extends Model
    {
        use HasUserAttributes;
    }
    ```

3. Now you can easily set custom attributes to your model like this:

    ```php
    $product = new Product();
    $product->user_attributes->color = 'red';
    $product->save();
    ```

4. Getting the attribute is just as easy:

    ```php
    $product = Product::find(1);
    echo $product->user_attributes->color; // 'red'
    ```

5. Destroying all user attributes is as easy as:

    ```php
    $product = Product::find(1);
    unset($product->user_attributes);
    $product->save();
    ```

## Manual configuration
